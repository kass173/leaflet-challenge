## My dataset.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated regulary. I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed Links to my external site/page and chose a dataset to visualize. (Eathquakes over the last 7 days).
I began by using JSON to represent that data. Connecting the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

I then Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:

Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude of eathquakes around the world in the last 7 days.

My data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

My markers include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

I also on the side create a legend that will provide context for my map data.
